## How the System Works

1. **Enter Your Location** (First Time)
   - You'll be asked "Where are you right now?"
   - Type your city name or area
   - System remembers your location

2. **Enter Your Query**
   - Type what you want naturally
   - Can mention: budget, mood, days, distance, location
   - System extracts constraints automatically

3. **Get Recommendations**
   - Destinations ranked by relevance
   - Distances calculated from YOUR location
   - See budget match, mood match, duration fit
   - View scores for each destination

## Distance Calculation

The system will:
- ✓ Ask for your current location (once)
- ✓ Calculate distance from you to each destination
- ✓ Prioritize nearby places if you mention "within X km"
- ✓ Show which destinations are closest

## Example Interaction

```
You: "I'm in Mumbai"
System: [Location saved]

You: "5000 rupees, adventure for 4 days"
System: Shows recommendations with distances from Mumbai:
  1. Manali (900 km away) - Score: 0.92
  2. Goa (500 km away) - Score: 0.85
  3. Shimla (1200 km away) - Score: 0.78
```

## Tips for Better Queries

✓ Be natural - no special syntax needed
✓ Mention your location in first query
✓ Combine multiple preferences
✓ Can adjust later (just ask again)
✓ Use "near me" if you want close destinations
✓ Say "show all" to see all 10 destinations

## What NOT to Do

✗ Don't use strict syntax
✗ Don't worry about format
✗ Don't need to remember exact terms
✗ Can mix languages/casual speech
✗ Can be vague (system handles it)

## System Understands

- Budget constraints: 1000, 5000, 50000, "expensive", "cheap"
- Moods: adventure, relax, party, culture, spiritual, romance, nature
- Durations: 1 day, 4 days, week, weekend
